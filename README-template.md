## My process

1. First create an html skelton.
2. Create the mobile layout
3. Create the desktop layout

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this section I learned how to offset elements for styling purposes using translate. For example:
.review:first-of-type {
transform: translateX(-2rem);
}

### Continued development

The concepts used in this project although can be called simple, I still find them essential for understanding workflows and creating best-practice approaches when beginning a project.

These concepts need to continue to be hammered down until I have a natural grasp of them.
